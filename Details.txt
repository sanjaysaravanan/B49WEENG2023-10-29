  Redux:
    External library for state management using different reducers

    Install the package with ---> npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
    react-redux
    Chrome-Extension - redux-devtools

    Process:

      1. Store Setup with initial State and reducers
        for manipulation of the store 
          1. Store Setup
          2. Reducers to feeded to the store
          3. Actions to be executed on reducers
      2. Actions ()
      3. Reducers ()
      4. Consume the store values
        hook in react-redux called as useSelector
      5. Dispatch --> hook in react-redux called as useDispatch

  Large Applications uses Redux to Manage the 
    State, Actions, Data as a whole

  Example:
    Assume Gmail Application ( Doesn't Mean Gamil use Redux ) 
    uses a lot of components
      1. User ( mailid )
      2. Compose ( Subject, To, CC, BCC )
      3. Drafts ( Mail which is unfinished ) --> Drafts Count Increases
      4. Categories, Junk, Starred, Important, Chats.
    
    Also, Jira Board

    Above entities/features of application uses different types of Desgin, Interactions, States from minor/small frontend actions

    This case managing the state/data only with basic state( state, reducer, context) on inidividual components and passing the data to the required components is very difficult

    May lead to props drilling or more num of callbacks/re-renders

  So, should we use redux everywhere or not
    ans: this depends on Your requirements

  Concept to Understand Redux:
    Think a Online Order scenario,

      what are all the end-to-end steps in an online order

      1. Order - Delivery Date 
      2. Collect the Order items from Seller( Store )
      3. Package and Delivery Initiataion
      4. Dispatched 
      5. Reaches desitnation and delivered
      6. Check the prod and use it is Good

  useReducer ( Redux like hook which help understanding redux )
